I work at [BUPT University](https://www.hhu.edu.cn/) as an assistant professor now in Nanjing. 

I graduated from Northwestern Polytechnical University with a bachelor's degree, from Université de Technologie de Belfort-Montbéliard (France) with a master's degree, and a Ph.D in Computer Science from Université d'Angers, France, supervised by [Jin-Kao Hao](https://leria-info.univ-angers.fr/~jinkao.hao/). 

My research interest includes large-scale combinatorial optimization and intelligent optimization algorithms, which are mainly applied in vehicle routing, chip resource scheduling, graph layout, etc. The main published papers appear in EJOR, ESWA, KBS and EAAI.  I have received several research grants from [National Science Foundation of China (NSFC)](https://www.nsfc.gov.cn/) and [Ministry of Education of the People's Republic of China](http://www.moe.gov.cn/).
